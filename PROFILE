summary  : Experimental logic system w/ clean Ruby syntax
description: >
  This is an expiremntal predicate logic system for Ruby.
  The logic engine is dreafully inefficent, but the
  main purpose of this expirment is the syntax used which
  is very clean. It would cool to see this syntax tied
  to a good backtracker or other solid logic system.
